      In 1780, French émigré Charles Darnay is on trial in London for treason
      against the British Crown. The key witnesses against him are two British
      spies, John Barsad and Roger Cly. Barsad claims that he would recognise
      Darnay anywhere, but Darnay's lawyer points out that his colleague in
      court, Sydney Carton, bears a strong resemblance to the prisoner. With
      Barsad's testimony thus undermined, Darnay is acquitted

      In Paris, the hated and abusive Marquis St. Evrémonde orders his carriage
      driven recklessly fast through the crowded streets, hitting and killing a
      child. The Marquis throws a coin to the child's father, Gaspard, to
      compensate him for his loss; as the Marquis drives on, a coin is flung
      back into the carriage
